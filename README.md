# Penning trap
This program contains modelling code for analytical and numerical calculations with a penning trap. A test approach is outlined in the mainfile. 
The following classes are used in solving of Penning trap models:
- Particle. Initializing particle values for addition to the penning traps. 
- PenningTrap. Sets up the environment for modelling of the Pt. 
- Solver. Numerical FE, Fourth-order Runge-Kutta and analytical soulutions.

To create a program which you have defined in main, simply run the make program in your termimnal.
Have fun!

This project is created by Felix Forseth and Edvin Jarve.

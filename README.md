# Penning trap
This program contains modelling code for analytical and numerical calculations with singly-charged Calcium ions in a penning trap. A test approach is outlined in the mainfile. 
The following classes are used in sovling of penning trap models:
- Particle. Initializing particle values for addition to the penning traps. 
- PenningTrap. Sets up the environment for modelling of the pt. 
- Solver. Numerical FE, Fourth-order Runge-Kutta and analytical soulutions.

Have fun!

This project is created by Felix Forseth and Edvin Jarve.
